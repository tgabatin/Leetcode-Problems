Find the Difference of Two Arrays

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2
where:

* answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2
* answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1

Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.
